TOSECONDS

TOSECONDS takes arbitrary number of pairs of Strings and Integers.
It then converts the time to seconds according to the content of 
the String.
We can assume that Strings are all in the form of h, min, or sec. 

Input: TOSECONDS 1 h 10 min 30 sec
Output: 3690 sec

Input: TOSECONDS 2 min 15 sec
Output: 135 sec

Input TOSECONDS 60 sec
Output 60 sec
